# gitstats
GitStats is a handy tool for understanding Git repositories. It looks at the history of changes and figures out things like who contributed, how many lines of code were added or removed, and more. All this information is neatly organized in a CSV file. It's designed for Java code projects, helping to track changes and contributions in an easy-to-read way.
